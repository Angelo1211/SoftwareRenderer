# Simple Software Graphics Engine(SSGE): A real-time and interactive 3D Renderer built from scratch in C++

SSGE is the result of a two month long learning project with the aim of building a real-time 3D renderer from scratch in C++. It is capable of modern Physically Based Rendering(PBR) without making use of any third party graphics libraries such as OpenGL, DirectX or Vulkan. It is entirely software based and does not utilize any hardware acceleration throughout it's rendering pipeline. SSGE can run on both Windows and Linux machines by leveraging CMAKE for executable building and compiling and SDL2 for OS and hardware-level abstraction.

Performance wise, it is capable of running scenes containing medium size meshes of ~50k triangles and 4 light sources at a relatively stable frame rate of 30fps (Of course, your mileage may vary) while running the very demanding PBR shader. To achieve this it makes heavy use of multithreading, SIMD directives and various other optimizations such as early backface culling, frustum culling and texture tiling among others.

You can download a demo of it for your machine here:

### Project is now on hold :(

Unfortunately this project is no longer maintained. I got hired to work at Rockstar Games as a Graphics Programmer shortly after posting this and don't have the time to work on a sideproject of this size anymore. I plan on keeping it up (as well as my other major graphics project [HRE](https://github.com/Angelo1211/HybridRenderingEngine)) so others can see what it took me to break into the industry. I will still be helping anyone who runs into any issues with it or has any questions about it. Feel free to reach me here or at [my twitter](https://twitter.com/aortizelguero) about this or any other GFX topic you'd like to talk about! Thanks to everyone who checked this project out! :D

## Development & Feedback

I am planning on starting a series of blog posts sometime soon that will explain some of the cooler components of the engine and how I went about implementing them. I also feel it would be helpful to other beginners if I were to elaborate on some of the components that gave me the most trouble, such as how to design the general architecture of the engine, how to profile, optimize and bug fix your code and lastly how I personally tackled learning Computer Graphics coming from a non-cs background. 

#### Goals
1. Demonstrate my C++ Knowledge
2. Satisfy a life long curiosity about computer graphics
3. Keep the renderer Real-Time (original goal was 16ms actual ~29ms)
4. Minimize external library usage to minimum
5. Multiplatform development
6. Use modern computer graphics techniques
7. Learn to self-manage and architect "large" projects

I set these goals above as my learning targets for the project before I began and I have to say that I am very happy with how much progress I managed to make with most of them. If you're interested, I gave a talk that went more in detail about this and the journey in itself and you can find the slides for it here:

* Jaggies from lack of antialiasing 
* No shadows causing undesired illumination in some models
* Stuttering during slow rotations from lack of sub-pixel precision
